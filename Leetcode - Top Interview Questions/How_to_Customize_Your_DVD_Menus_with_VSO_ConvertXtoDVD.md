## How to Create Your Own Menu Template
 
If you want to create your own menu template from scratch, you will need some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, as well as a text editor and an image editor. You will also need to follow the VSO Software guidelines for creating menu templates, which you can find [here](http://www.vso-software.fr/guides/cxd/cxd-menu-template-creation.php). Here are the main steps to create your own menu template:

1. Create a folder with the name of your menu template and place it in C:\ProgramData\VSO\ConvertXToDVD\6\Templates (or the corresponding folder for your version of ConvertXtoDVD).
2. Create an .ini file with the same name as your folder and place it in the folder. This file will contain the general information and settings of your menu template.
3. Create an .html file for each menu type (title, root, chapter, settings) and place them in the folder. These files will contain the HTML code for each menu page.
4. Create a .css file for each menu type and place them in the folder. These files will contain the CSS code for each menu page.
5. Create any images or videos you want to use as background or buttons for your menu template and place them in the folder.
6. Edit the .ini file to specify the name, description, structure and theme of your menu template, as well as the paths to the .html, .css and image files.
7. Edit the .html files to define the layout and content of each menu page, using HTML tags and variables provided by VSO Software.
8. Edit the .css files to style each menu page, using CSS properties and variables provided by VSO Software.
9. Save your files and open ConvertXtoDVD to test your menu template in the preview window or by burning a DVD.
